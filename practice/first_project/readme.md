This is to keep track of how i setup this project. I'm a beginner so forgive me.

1. Create project directory (with `mkdir` or through the file explorer)
2. Move to your project directory with `cd`
3. Use `cargo build` to build the project in the project directory
4. To build the project and then immediately run the code use `cargo run` in place of `cargo build`
5. To check for errors before compilation use `cargo check`
